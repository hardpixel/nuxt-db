# I like seafood. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?

I'm generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?

I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. You're a killer. I catch killers.
