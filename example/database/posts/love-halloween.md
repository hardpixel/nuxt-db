# I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask â€¦ not just me

I'm generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?

I like seafood. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.
